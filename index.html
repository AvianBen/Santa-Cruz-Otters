					<p>Hello and welcome! If you are here, prepare yourself to enter the world of a sea otter! Otters are a semiaquatic mammal that belong to the Mustelidae family (such as weasels, skunks, etc), and in fact are the largest of this group! They spend their days hunting for prey, grooming themselves and their pups, floating on the ocean surface, and resing up for their next feeding sesh. Although they are endangered, their populations are currently on the rise, and they thrive right here in Santa Cruz! </p>
