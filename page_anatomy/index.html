					<p>Welcome! Here you can click on the picture in order to reveal the anatomy of the otter!</p>

					<p>Otters are one of the smallest marine mammals. Their whiskers help them to detect vibrations in murky waters. They can also close their ears and nostrils underwater!</p>

					<p>They have webbed feet, which are also flipper shaped in order to help them to propel themselves through the water.</p>
